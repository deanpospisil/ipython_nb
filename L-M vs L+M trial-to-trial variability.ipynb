    "Patty adapted V1 neurons to $L=M=S$ cone excitation or grey where firing rates were typically very low. Then while holding grey in one subunit he varied the amount of L and M excitation in the other subunit while holding S excitation constant. Then at $n$ points in the LM plane he completed $m$ repetitions of stimulation. He found a subset of neurons responses were well fit by an LN model defined by a direction and monotonically increasing nonlinearity in the LM plane. "

I not going to consider the surround of these cells only the center considering stimulation was performed in the center of the subunit. I will model the resulting average changes in voltage post-stimulus from the ON and OFF cells as a normal random variable whose variance is proportional to its mean: $$P(d) \\sim N(I_{[0,+ \\infty]}(d), sI_{[0,+ \\infty]}(d))$$ with $s \\geq 0$, ignoring the fact that we can get negative values from these inputs.\n",
